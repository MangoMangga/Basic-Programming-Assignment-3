This program is a simple Airline Ticket Reservation System written in Python.
It allows users to book seats, view seat availability, search passengers, cancel bookings, and save booking data.

How It Works

- Passenger details are managed using a Passenger class.
- Users interact with the system through a menu-based interface.
- Booking data is saved to and loaded from a text file (booking_ticket.txt).
